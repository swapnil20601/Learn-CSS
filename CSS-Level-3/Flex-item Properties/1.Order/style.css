/*
Initially the boxes are in order 1,2,3,4. There is a use case where you want to change the order of boxes
Lets say I want to place:
    - box 1 at the end
    - box 3 at the end
    - box 2 in between box 1 and box 3
*/

    /*This place box 1 at the end.
    So order will be: 2,3,4,1
    Default value is 0. Anyhting other than 0 will place box 1 at the end*/
    order: 1;
}

#box3{
     /*This will place box 3 after box 1 i.e at the end.
    So order will be: 2,4,1,3
    You can give any value other than 1 to place box 3 after box 1 because
    box 1's order is set to 1 & since you want to put it after box1, you will have to provide
    value > 1*/
    order:6;
}

#box2{
     /*This will place box 2 between box 1 & 3.
    So order will be: 4,1,2,3
    To do this, You can give any value between 1 & 6 i.e val > 1 and val < 6because
    box 1's order is set to 1 & box 3's order is already set to 6.
    Since you want to  place box 2 between box 1 & 3., you will have to provide
    value in range 2 to 5*/
